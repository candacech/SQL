We're going to work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store 
and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

--How many customers outside the U.S.?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'

--Who is the head manager of chinook?
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees AS emp
WHERE emp.title LIKE '%Manager'
AND emp.ReportsTo IS NULL

--What's the average price of the items invoiced?
SELECT avg(UnitPrice) AS avg_price
FROM chinook.invoice_items 

--How much revenue was made in January 2010?
SELECT SUM(Quantity*UnitPrice) AS Revenue
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS ii
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON ii.invoiceid = i.invoiceid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '2010-01-%'


--Use a subquery to show how many heavy metal tracks were invoiced.
--Note: heavy metal has genreid 13
SELECT COUNT(invoiceid) FROM invoice_items 
WHERE trackid IN(SELECT trackid FROM tracks
WHERE genreid = '13')

--Show the length of each song and create a column that states if it's short,long,or average.
SELECT name,milliseconds,
 CASE WHEN milliseconds > 400000 THEN 'Long'
      WHEN milliseconds < 380000 THEN 'Short'
      ELSE 'Average'
    END AS 'Song Length'
FROM tracks
GROUP BY milliseconds 

--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1
